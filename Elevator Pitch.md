# Elevator Pitch

Disclaimer:

### Start your pitch with an introduction
Start with an introduction of 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) that includes your name and provides a brief overview of your professional background. 
Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. 
If this is your first job in cybersecurity, mention some of your previous jobs that had relatable or transferable skills.

### Express your interest in the role
In an elevator pitch, it’s important to get to the point as quickly as possible. 
Write 1-2 sentences (20-40 words) explaining why the role interests you and why you want to work in the industry.

### Describe your relevant experience and skills
Next, review the relevant experience and skills you recorded in Step 3. 
In 2-4 sentences (40-80 words), highlight your experience and skills to communicate the value you would bring to the position. 
Describe the strengths you have that make you a good fit for the role. 
Consider mentioning your completion of this certificate program and other relevant coursework. 
And, if applicable, describe a particular project you worked on that relates to the requirements for the role.

### Communicate your interest in the company
Communicating why you are interested in the company helps show the interviewer that you are knowledgeable about the company and not just the role. 
Refer to the description of the company you recorded in Step 3. 
Then, write 1-2 sentences (20-40 words) indicating that you understand the company’s mission and expressing your desire to work for them.

### Proofread and revise your draft
Once you’re done with your first draft, proofread and revise it. 
Set a timer and read your draft out loud to check if it fits within the 30–60 second limit. 
While checking to see it fits within that time frame, it’s also important not to talk too quickly. 
Talking too fast can make your elevator pitch hard to understand. If necessary,  edit it down. 
Remember, you want to be able to quickly deliver your elevator pitch and capture your audience’s attention. 
Reading your pitch out loud can also help you identify any awkward phrasing and refine your writing.
