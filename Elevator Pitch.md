# Elevator Pitch

Disclaimer:

## Final Draft
My name is Melanie Daniel, and I’m currently studying a B.Sc. in Cybersecurity. Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, running, and horse riding; which keeps me disciplined, curious, and focused. My work experience spans roles as a waitress, event promoter, digital marketing intern, house sitter, and babysitter. Through these, I’ve developed strong soft skills; such as active listening, empathy, communication, and brand management; that set me apart in cybersecurity.

What excites me most about the field is solving complex problems, protecting people and data, and exploring the psychology of social engineering—understanding both the attacker’s mindset and the victim’s behavior. As an aspiring SOC analyst, I believe my attention to detail, analytical problem-solving, and strong people skills will allow me to collaborate effectively, communicate clearly with different audiences, and build trust with clients and colleagues.

I’m particularly interested in this role because your company offers training for entry-level analysts and operates globally while still maintaining a close-knit environment. With my sense of justice, curiosity, and drive for continuous growth, I’m confident I can contribute meaningfully to your team while developing into a skilled cybersecurity professional.
