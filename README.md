# Activity Draft an elevator pitch
In this activity, I researched cybersecurity roles on a job search website and recorded notes on a position that interested me. Then, I practiced preparing to interview for that role by writing an elevator pitch. 

Disclaimer:

An elevator pitch is a short, memorable description that explains a concept in an easy-to-understand way. Elevator pitches are helpful for introducing yourself to career and business connections. They can be used in formal and informal ways. For example, meeting another security practitioner at an industry event or during a job interview.
