# Scenario

Disclaimer:

To create a strong elevator pitch, you need to consider how to present yourself as a suitable candidate for a specific role. Before you begin writing your pitch, you will determine what industry benefits you are looking for in a cybersecurity role. Then, you will research relevant roles on a job search website and identify one that appeals to you. Next, you will review the job description for the position and record key information about your relevant experience,  skills, and details about the company. After, you will write a 30- to 60-second elevator pitch using that information. Your elevator pitch will focus on describing yourself, your professional experience and skills, and why you are  an ideal candidate for the role. 

Note: While this is a practice exercise and you won’t actually be applying for the role you’ve identified (unless you choose to), you can implement this process to search for relevant roles and draft corresponding elevator pitches in the future.
